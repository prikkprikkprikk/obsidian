1. Review players' goals.

2. Identify faction overlap. (Who are with you and/or against the players in reaching their goals?)

3. Identify NPC goals.

4. Location. (Where do the players need to go/be to accomplish their goals?)

5. Identify the conflict.

6. Choose rewards.

7. Collect materials. (Whatever is necessary to play this mission.)
