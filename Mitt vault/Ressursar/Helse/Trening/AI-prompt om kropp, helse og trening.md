I would like to get in better shape. I'm not terribly out of shape, but I tend to lapse during the cold, dark winter months (so-called winter depression, maybe?). Now it's springtime here in south-eastern Norway where I live, and the weather is nice most of the time, and I'm motivated.

Some important facts about me:

- Gender: male
- Age: 52 years old (born 1973)
- Height: 187 cm
- Weight: 97 kg
- Work: Occupation: Developer (sits at desk all workdays). At the office Monday and Thursday, about 45 minute commute by electric car. Leave 05:45, back home 15:45. Working from home Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Start 06:30, get off work 14:30.
- Family: Female partner, 40 years old, she is also actively working out at about the same level as me. I have two daughters, 13 and 10 years old, partner has one daughter, 6 years old. We have all the kids every other week, and no kids the other weeks.
- Weight goal: I feel that I’m at least 10 kg overweight. I would like to get my body weight down to around 85 kg. I’m settling for that number because I used to be around 80 kg before (10-15 years ago), but then I was untrained, so I include about 5 kg in increased muscle mass.
- Strength goal: I want to have general strength and flexibility to support my job, my running goals and general fitness.
- Running goal: I would like to run 5 km in under 30 minutes. I have no rush, though. It’s important for me to take it slowly and avoid injuries.

Preferences and bodily problems to consider:

- I slouch a bit, so I need to strengthen my core and back to improve my posture. I quite like rowing-type exercises, pull-downs etc. for this reason.
- My shoulders are pretty weak and prone to injures, so I tend to avoid things like push-ups, chin-ups, face pulls and similar exercises. But at the same time, I would like to strengthen them in a safe and injure-free way.
- My right knee has some kind of problem, which I discovered when I did sumo deadlifts some years ago. I suspect this is due to my hips being slightly askew (right hip is a little bit more forward than the left if I stand upright) so that the load on each knee is slightly different, and I’m overcompensating. This is just a theory, though, and something I noticed only recently, but concentrating on straightening my hips while doing deadlifts has helped reduced the strain on my right knee.
- I tend to get shin splints if I’m not very careful with my running. I prefer long warm-ups and run-walk-run routines. I’ve gotten much better at landing on my forefoot instead of my heel, but this also means I need to strengthen my calf muscles.
- I much prefer running on uneven and soft grounds, not paved roads, which very quickly give me trouble in my feet and lower legs. We are fortunate to live next to woods with lots of hiking tracks, where I love to run.
- I’ve also recently realized I have sleep apnea. I’m not snoring, but it feels like my soft palate and throat kind of collapses when I’m totally relaxed during sleep, even when I’m sleeping on my side, not just my back. I’m hoping this will get better with weight loss and better posture and core strength.
- I’ve recently started doing intermittent fasting again, which means I don’t eat anything until lunch at about 11:00–11:30. This works very well for me.
- I do have a Garmin fenix 7 watch, and use the FitBod app for strength training. My partner uses an app called Freeletics, that I want to try.
- Some years ago, I spent a lot of money on a PT for about two years; the first year, twice a week, the second year, once a week. I learned a lot about how to do strength training safely and effectively. I prefer less weight/resistance and more repetitions, rather than heavy and few. I do not care about gaining huge muscle mass, but want a strong, flexible and moderately lean body.
- I am a member of a local gym, where I can do strength training. I do not like group activities, I prefer to train on my own.
- We do have a deck at the back of the house where we can do exercises, and do have a training/yoga mat and a set of adjustable dumbbells, so we can do some (mostly body weight) training at home.
