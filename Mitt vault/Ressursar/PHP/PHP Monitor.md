**PHP Monitor** (or _phpmon_) is a lightweight macOS utility app that runs on your Mac and displays the active PHP version in your status bar. It’s tightly integrated with [Laravel Valet](https://github.com/laravel/valet), so you need to have it set up before you can use this app (consult the FAQ below with info about how to set up your environment).
