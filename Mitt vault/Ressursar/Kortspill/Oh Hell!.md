## Introduction

This game, in which players try to predict the exact number of tricks  
they will win, first appeared in London and New York in the 1930's and  
has since become popular in many parts of the world. Its original name **Oh Hell!** evidently offended some people and has been bowdlerised in many books to **Oh Pshaw!** or **Oh Well!**, while others have preferred more robust alternatives such as **Oh Shit!** Some call it **Blob** or **Blackout**,  
perhaps because of the practice of recording a player's bid on the  
scoresheet and then obliterating it with a black blob if the player  
failed to take the predicted number of tricks. Traditionally the size of  
the players' hands increases or decreases by one in each deal, and this  
has given rise to the names **Elevator** (**l'Ascenseur** in France), **Up and Down the River** (in Australia and New Zealand) and **10 op en neer** in the Netherlands. In Britain it is often known as **Contract Whist** or as [Nomination Whist](https://www.pagat.com/whist/nomination.html), a name which also sometimes refers to [different games](https://www.pagat.com/whist/nomination.html). Other names include **Bust** (in Australia and New Zealand), **Boerenbridge** (in the Netherlands) and **German Bridge** (in Hong Kong). In India the game is called (in Gujurati) **Kachuful**, which is a mnemonic for the order of cycling through the trump suits: **Ka**ri (spades), **Chu**kat (diamonds), **F**alli (clubs), **L**al (hearts) and in Pakistan it is **765**.

## Players and Cards

From 3 to 7 people can play. The game is best when played with 4 to 6.

A standard 52 card deck is used. The cards in each suit rank (from high to low) **A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2**.

## Sequence of Hands

The **game** consists of a series of **hands**. The first hand is played with 7 to 10 cards dealt to each player, depending on the number of players:

- 3 to 5 players, 10 cards each;
- 6 players, 8 cards each;
- 7 players, 7 cards each

(because of the limit of 52 cards available). Each successive hand is  
played with one card fewer, down to a hand of just one card each, then  
one card more per hand back up to the starting level.

**Example**: With 7 players, the hands are: 7 cards, then  
6,5,4,3,2,1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7, for a total of 13 hands to the game. A  
game should take approximately 45 minutes.

## Object of the Game

The object is for each player to **bid** the number of  
tricks he thinks he can take from each hand, then to take exactly that  
many; no more and no fewer. Points are awarded only for making the bid  
exactly, and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under (see  
[scoring](https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html#scoring) below).

The **hook** is that at least one player will fail on each  
hand, because the total number of tricks bid by the players may not  
equal the number of tricks available on that hand.

## Deal

To determine the first dealer, draw cards. The player with the highest  
card deals first. The turn to deal rotates clockwise with each hand.

The cards are shuffled and cut and the dealer deals the cards singly until everyone has the [appropriate number of cards](https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html#sequence) for the hand being played. The next card is turned face up and the suit of this card is the **trump suit**  
for the hand. The trump suit beats any of the other three suits played  
in that hand. The remaining undealt cards are placed in a face down  
stack with the turned trump on top of it.

## Bidding

The bidding in each hand begins with the player to the left of the  
dealer, then continues clockwise, back around to the dealer, who bids  
last. Each bid is a number representing the number of tricks that player  
will try to take. Everyone must bid - it is not possible to pass, but  
you can bid zero, in which case your object is to take no tricks at all.  
A bid may be changed only if the next player to the left has not yet  
bid. Remember the **hook**: the dealer may not bid the  
number that would cause the total number of tricks bid to equal the  
number of tricks available; a hand will always be "over-bid" or  
"under-bid". Keep in mind when bidding that not all cards in the deck  
are in play in any hand.

## Play

The play begins with the player to the dealer's left, who leads the  
first card. The lead may be any suit (including trump). Play follows  
clockwise. Each player must follow the suit led, if he can. If not, he  
may play any other card in his hand, including trump. The player who has  
played the highest trump card, or if no trump was played, the highest  
card of the suit led, wins the trick. That player then leads to the next  
trick. Continue until all tricks have been played and won.

## Scoring

The **scorekeeper** is designated prior to each game  
according to house rules. The scorekeeper, needless to say, has a  
distinct advantage, and should be monitored closely for "inadvertent"  
errors. The designated scorekeeper notes each bid and resulting scores  
on a score sheet. There are many different ways to score Oh Hell!

In the simplest version, a player who wins the exact number of tricks  
bid scores 10 plus the number of tricks bid (10 points for zero tricks,  
11 for 1 trick, 12 for two tricks, etc.) Players who take more or fewer  
tricks than they bid score nothing. This method has the advantage that  
the scorekeeper, having written down the bids at the start of the play,  
can simply write a figure "1" in front of those that were successful and  
delete those that are not. The game with this scoring method is often  
known as **Blackout** or **Blob**, because the scorer obliterates or blacks out unsuccessful bids, so that they become black blobs on the score sheet.

Perhaps the most widespread scoring method is to award 1 point for each  
trick won plus a bonus of 10 points for players who win exactly the  
number of tricks they bid. So for example a player who bid 2 would score  
12 points for winning exactly 2 tricks, but only 1 for 1 trick and 3  
for 3 tricks. This gives a player whose bid fails a slight incentive to  
win as many tricks as possible.

Some other scoring methods are given in the [variations section](https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html#scoring-vars)  
below. Whatever method is used, the score keeper keeps a cumulative  
total of each player's score. The final cumulative scores determine the  
result. If the game is played for money, players pay or receive amounts  
corresponding to the difference of their scores from the average.

Several people have produced preprinted [Oh Hell score sheets and applications](https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html#scoreapp), reflecting various scoring methods.

## Variations

### Sequence of Hands

There are a lot of variations of this. Some people start from 1 card  
each, go up to the maximum number of cards and then back down to 1. Some  
just go from the maximum down to 1 and then stop, or vice versa. Some  
people go from the maximum down to 1, then from 1 up to the maximum, so  
playing two 1-card hands in the middle, or from 1 to the maximum to 1  
with two maximum hands in the middle. If there are four people the  
maximum number of cards dealt may be 13 rather than 10, with three  
people you can go up to 17. Some people go up to some other maximum,  
such as 7 cards, irrespective of the number of players.

Dan Strohm describes a version, called **Devil's Bridge**,  
in which the hand size increases and then decreases. On the final 1 card  
hand, the players must each hold their card on their forehead, so each  
player can see all the other player's cards but not their own.

Bryce Francis reports that in Australia, when playing Bust with 5  
players, they add 13 low cards from a second pack to make a 65 card  
pack, so as to deal 13 cards each on the first hand as with 4 players.  
When there are six players they add a further 13 low cards, so that the  
bottom half of the pack is duplicated. If duplicate cards are played to a  
trick, the second played beats the first.  
  
A 3-player game is also possible, removing 13 low cards from a single  
pack.

### Determining Trumps

Some sequences include hands in which all cards are dealt (for example  
13 cards each to 4 players). There is of course then no card left to  
determine the trump suit. These hands are played without trumps. Some  
play the largest deals without trumps even if not all the cards are  
used.

Instead of turning up a card, some people go through the possible trump  
suits in a fixed sequence. This sequence may or may not include "no  
trumps".

In the Indian (Gujurati) game **Kachuful**, the sequence  
of trump suits is spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts and the name of the  
game, which literally means 'raw flower', is also a mnemonic for this  
sequence: Ka = Kari = Spades,  
Chu = Chukat = Diamonds,  
Fu = Falli = Clubs, L = Lal = Hearts

Brad Wilson describes a version called "Oh Shit!" in which Spades are always trumps.

Jean-Pierre Coulon reports a variation in which after the appropriate  
number of cards have been dealt to the players, the next card is turned  
face up. If the rank of the turned up card is from 2 to 6, there are no  
trumps for the deal; if it is 7 or higher, the suit of the turned up  
card is trumps.

### Bidding

Some people play without the **hook** rule, so the dealer  
is allowed to bid in such a way that everyone can win. There was a  
lively discussion in rec.games.playing-cards as to which version is more  
skilful, with strong advocates of each. Some think that hands where the  
bids add up are too easy; but others say that forcing the bids not to  
add up removes a tactical option from the dealer.

Some play with **simultaneous bidding**. When the players  
are ready to bid, they put a fist on the table. When everyone's fist is  
out, the group says "One, Two, Three" while bouncing their fists on the  
table. On Three, everyone must stick out some number of fingers  
(possibly zero) to indicate how many tricks they will try to take. Of  
course, with this method, there's no restriction against the total  
number of bid tricks being equal to the number of cards dealt. Since  
players cannot adjust their bids based on the other players' bids, the  
total tricks bid can be wildly different from the tricks available - for  
example it is not uncommon for three or four players to bid "one" when  
only one card was dealt. Several correspondents report that in  
Australia, most groups use simultaneous bidding rather than bidding in  
turn.

### Play

Some play that the dealer, rather than the player to dealer's left, leads to the first trick.

David Wuori (of Maine, USA) reports a variation in which a player who  
has no card of the suit led must trump. Only if you have no cards of  
the suit led and no trumps can you discard from a different non-trump  
suit. Although this is rule is uncommon in English speaking countries,  
it is actually the usual way of playing [La Podrida](https://www.pagat.com/exact/podrida.html) (the Spanish equivalent to Oh Hell played in Latin America and in Spain) as well as the equivalent Romanian game of [Whist](https://www.pagat.com/exact/romwhist.html).

Mark Brader suggests a variation in which two jokers are included, to  
make a 54-card deck. These jokers are a suit of their own containing  
just two equal cards. If a joker is led it wins the trick unless  
trumped. If a joker is turned up the other joker is the only trump.

Dick Atkinson reports a version of Blackout for 5 or 6  
players, played in Northeast England in the 1970s. Two jokers are added  
to the pack, and if there are 5 players the four deuces are removed  
leaving 50 cards. With 5 players the deal is always 10 cards each and  
with 6 players 9 cards each. The trump suit rotates from deal to deal in  
the order hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades. The dealer could not make  
the bid total equal the number of cards dealt. Jokers could not be led  
(unless the player had no other cards) and could not be played in the  
first trick. Apart from that, a joker could be played to any trick (even  
if the player could have followed suit). The first player of a joker  
could nominate it as either "high", automatically winning the trick or  
"low", automatically losing. The player of the second joker had no  
choice: it would be low if the first joker was high and high if the  
first was low. If a player was forced to lead a joker, the first suited  
card played determined the suit of the trick.

### Scoring

There are many alternative systems.

- Some players give the usual 10-point bonus for a successful positive bid but award only 5 points for a successful bid of zero. Others award 5 plus the number of cards dealt to each player for a successful zero  
    bid, recognising the fact that zero is more difficult when more cards  
    are dealt.
- Some score 10 points for each trick bid and won for a  
    successful bid. A successful "zero" bid wins 10 points. A player whose  
    bid is unsuccessful (over or under) loses 10 points times the difference between the number of tricks won and the number of tricks bid.
- Another system is that you win 5 points if you are right plus  
    10 for each trick taken, and you lose 5 points if you are wrong plus an  
    extra 5 for each trick difference from your bid.
- Yet another system: if you make your bid exactly you score 10 points plus the **square** of the number of tricks you bid (i.e. 10 points for none, 11 for one,  
    14 for two, 19 for three, 26 for four, etc.); if you fail you **lose** the **square** of the difference between the number of tricks you bid and the number of tricks you took.
- Some play for a single winner, who is the player with the  
    highest score when the whole series of hands has been played. In case of a **tie** after the last hand, some deal further hand(s)  
    with the maximum number of cards until a clear winner is determined. The winner may not be any of those involved in the original tie - any  
    player can win until the end.

### More variations

The [Oh Hell Variations](https://www.pagat.com/invented/oh_hell_vars.html) page in the Invented Games section of this site has a collection of Oh Hell variations contributed by readers.

### Boerenbridge

A version of Oh Hell! under the Dutch name **Boerenbridge** was  
formerly available to play against three computer opponents at  
Kaartspellen online (www.useme.nl/kaartspellen). In the variation  
offered there:

- The whole pack is dealt every time - 13 cards each to four players.
- Bidding is simultaneous.
- Score 1 point for each trick won, plus a bonus of 10 is you make your bid exactly.
- If you bid and make zero you score 20 points.
- If your score is 80 or more you do not take part in the bidding, but just score 1 for each trick you win.
- The objective is to score exactly 100; if you go over 100 you bounce back - your excess over 100 is subtracted from 100.

### 7-Truf

Andi Beben describes the four-player variant **7-truf** played in Indonesia with a 32-card pack ranking from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in each suit. There are 22 deals as follows:

- 7 deals increasing from 1 card each to 7 cards each. A card is  
    turned from the undealt part of the pack to determine the trump suit.
- 4 deals with all acrds dealt: 8 cards each with no trumps.
- 7 deals decreasing from 7 cards each to 1 card each, and one of the remaining cards turned for trumps.
- 4 more deals with 8 cards each and no trumps.

Players bid in turn. The dealer's bid cannot make the total bids equal to the total number of tricks.

For a successful bid, the score is 10 times the bid, or 5 times the  
total number of tricks played for a successful zero bid. Unsuccessful  
players score 1 point per trick won.

**10 op en neer page**, described by Axel Brink, is a  
Dutch variant in which the number of cards dealt per hand are: 1, 2,  
..., 9, 10, 9, ..., 1. There is no hook rule. A bid made exactly scores  
10 points plus the bid: a missed bid (over or under) scores 0.
