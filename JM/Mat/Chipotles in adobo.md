### Ingredients

- 18-20 dried Chipotle Morita chiles
- 1/2 onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 Roma tomato
- 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon cumin
- 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 3/4 cup water (or soaking liquid)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- freshly cracked black pepper
- olive oil

### Instructions

- Wipe off any dusty crevasses on the Moritas using a wet towel.  Roast the Moritas in a 400F oven for 1-2 minutes.  Add the Moritas to a mixing bowl and cover them with the hottest tap water you've got.  Let the chiles reconstitute for 20-30 minutes.
    
- Note:  when the chiles are done reconstituting take a taste of the soaking liquid.  If you like the flavor of it you can use it for the adobo sauce.  If you don't like it or if it tastes bitter to you then you can use water for the adobo sauce. 
    
- Roast the Roma tomato in the oven (400F) for 20-30 minutes or until you need it. 
    
- Once the chiles have reconstituted, we'll use 6-7 of them for the adobo sauce.  De-stem and de-seed the chiles and add them to a blender of food processor along with the roasted tomato, the 1/2 onion (set aside a small chunk of it), 1 peeled garlic clove, 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar, and 1/2 cup water (or soaking liquid).   Combine well.
    
- Finely dice the leftover chunk of onion and saute it in some oil over medium heat until it softens.  Then add:  1 minced garlic clove, 1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, and some freshly cracked black pepper. 
    
- Saute briefly and then add the chipotle puree from the blender, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup water (or soaking liquid), and the remaining drained chiles.  Combine well and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until it has reduced down to your preferred consistency. 
    
- Take a final taste for seasoning, adding more salt, sugar, or spices if you want. 
    
- Store in a pint-sized Mason jar in the fridge where the chipotles will keep for weeks if not longer. 
    

### Notes

I used brown sugar for this batch but there is leeway on the sweetener.

I typically puree most of the onion in the adobo sauce to keep the adobo sauce liquidy.  For a chunkier version you can keep more of the onion for the saute and use less in the puree. 

Moritas are dense so I will sometimes let them reconstitute for longer than 30 minutes if I have time. 

Take a taste of the soaking liquid after the chiles reconstitute.  If you like the flavor you can use it in the adobo sauce, otherwise use water.
