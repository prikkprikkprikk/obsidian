- [**Two-Factor**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/)**:** This Plugin is developed by the WordPress team, and it enables **Two-Factor Authentication** using time-based one-time passwords (OTP, Google Authenticator), Universal 2nd Factor (FIDO U2F, YubiKey), email, and backup verification codes.
- - [**Patchstack**](https://patchstack.com/) **&** [**WPScan**](https://wpscan.com/)**:** A vulnerability scanner such as Patchstack or WPScan can be helpful in keeping track of vulnerabilities. WP Scan, for example, continuously checks for threats to your server against a known [database of 37,000+ vulnerabilities](https://wpscan.com/statistics) maintained by WordPress security professionals. If a threat is detected, it can trigger a **notification** via email or using a custom webhook with all the necessary information and recommendations for resolving the issue.
